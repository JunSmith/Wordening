# Wordening
  Year 3 Software Development final project developed by Jun Smith and Peter Burke.

  This game is developed in the Unity Game Engine and is compatible with the Windows Operating System. This game is developed to try and teach the user touch typing in a fun and intuitive fashion.

## How to play
Simply execute the "The Wordening.exe" by double clicking on the file located under the "Wordening" directory where you have downloaded it. The menus can be navigated by use of a pointing device such as a mouse and the game itself is played only using the keyboard as input. During the game, press the Escape key to pause and use the mouse to navigate the pause menu that appears from there.
